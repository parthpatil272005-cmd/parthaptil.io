<div class="project-details-box">

    <!-- OVERVIEW -->
    <h2 class="sub-project-title">Overview</h2>
    <p class="info-box">
        TIFAN 2025 was my first major engineering project during my second year of college. We restarted the entire design due to previous prototype failures in seed handling, alignment, and mechanical synchronization.
    </p>

    <!-- DESIGN BREAKDOWN -->
    <h2 class="sub-project-title">Design Breakdown</h2>

    <div class="info-box"><strong>Picking System:</strong> Lifts seedlings without damaging roots.</div>

    <!-- MY ROLE -->
    <h2 class="sub-project-title">My Role</h2>

    <div class="info-box">
        I contributed to mechanical design, system synchronization, and electronic selection.  
        My major responsibilities included:
        <br><br>
        ✔ Designing Geneva mechanism for conveyor indexing  
        <br>✔ Developing lead-screw based vertical and horizontal motion  
        <br>✔ Selecting NEMA stepper motors & electronic components  
        <br>✔ Precision tuning of pickup mechanism to reduce seedling damage  
        <br>✔ Testing & analyzing system timing via PLC feedback  
        <br>✔ Troubleshooting mechanical failures in field conditions  
        <br><br>
        I worked closely with seniors and faculty to refine the system until testing showed stable and reliable performance.
