        <h2 class="sub-project-title">Overview</h2>
        <p class="info-box">
            The EV Go-Kart was my first practical introduction to electric vehicle technology.  
            I joined the Electrical Department in my 1st year and continued leading electrical tasks through 2nd year.
            During this time, I learned EV circuitry, motor controllers, battery systems, safety protocols, and 
            software-based tuning for real-world competition use.
        </p>

        <p class="info-box">
            The goal of the project was to build a high-performance and reliable electric kart capable of 
            acceleration runs, endurance races, braking tests, and dynamic events. I contributed to electrical design,
            integration, troubleshooting, and system optimization.

        <div class="info-box">
            <strong>Boost Mode Development</strong><br>
            Programmed a temporary high-power output mode for quick acceleration & overtaking in competition.
        </div>

        <div class="info-box">
            <strong>Controller Optimization</strong><br>
            Tuned current limits, torque curves, and throttle mapping to increase efficiency and endurance.
        </div>

        <div class="info-box">
            <strong>Electrical Reliability</strong><br>
            Designed a clean wiring harness that passed scrutineering, vibration tests, and thermal checks.
